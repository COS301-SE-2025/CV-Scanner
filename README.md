## 🧠 About the Project

**CV-Scanner** is an AI-powered recruitment platform developed by **Quantum Stack** to revolutionize candidate screening. Leveraging state-of-the-art **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and AI models, the system intelligently extracts:
- Relevant technologies
- Soft skills and personality traits
- Project suitability indicators

It supports both **PDF and Word** CV formats and automatically summarizes candidate profiles into a secure, centralized database. These summaries are accessible via a **role-based admin portal**, ensuring efficient and secure HR workflows.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/Frontend-React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=white)
![Java Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/Backend-Java_Spring-6DB33F?logo=spring&logoColor=white)
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/Engine-C++-00599C?logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI-Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)

#### 🖼️ Frontend: React
We chose **React** for building the user interface due to its component-based architecture, fast rendering through a virtual DOM, and rich ecosystem of libraries. It enabled us to create a modern, responsive, and highly interactive UI efficiently.

#### ☕ Backend API: Java Spring Boot
**Spring Boot** was used for our backend REST API. It provides robust tools for building secure and scalable server-side applications, with excellent support for data access, service layers, and integration with enterprise systems. It also aligned well with our hosting and deployment constraints (e.g., Azure App Services).

#### 🧠 AI Service: Python
**Python** was selected for our AI/CV module due to its extensive machine learning and natural language processing libraries (like spaCy, scikit-learn, and OpenCV) and with the use of the BART Model in Facebook. It allowed us to rapidly prototype and integrate intelligent functionality into our system.
