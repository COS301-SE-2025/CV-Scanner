## ✅ Functional Requirements

1. The system must be able to process PDF and Word document CVs and extract relevant
technologies.

2. The system must generate a summary of the candidate's profile, including technology preferences
and personality traits.

3. The system must indicate the type of project the candidate would be most effective on (technical,
collaborative, business engagement, high-autonomy, etc.).

4. The system must save and link the extracted data and CV reference to a database that can be
viewed, edited, or optimized via an admin portal.

5. The system must allow admin users to specify skills to ignore and/or include specifically.
